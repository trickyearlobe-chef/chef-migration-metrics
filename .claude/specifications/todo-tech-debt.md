# Tech Debt

Status key: [ ] Not started | [~] In progress | [x] Done

---

## Frontend — Large Files

- [ ] `NodeDetailPage.tsx` (~1136 lines) contains 10+ sub-components — extract `DiskSpacePanel`, `CookbookCompatibilityTable`, `ReadinessCard`, `ReadinessSection`, `InfoCard` into separate files.
- [ ] `StatusCards.tsx` (~860 lines) — 7 cards each repeat the same fetch-load-error pattern; extract a `useFetch<T>` hook to eliminate boilerplate.

## Frontend — Inconsistency

- [ ] `RemediationPage.tsx` uses hand-rolled sort logic (L67–68, L151–164) instead of `useSort` hook + `SortableColumnHeader` that every other sortable page uses.
- [ ] `DownloadStatusBadge` (CookbooksPage) and `CloneStatusBadge` (GitReposPage) are near-identical — unify into a shared component.
- [ ] ~25 mutation functions in `api.ts` duplicate a 12-line error-handling pattern instead of using `apiFetch` — extend `apiFetch` to support void responses, then migrate.

## Backend — Code Smells

- [ ] `DataStore` interface has 138+ methods (`webapi/store.go`) — consider splitting into domain-specific sub-interfaces (nodes, cookbooks, kitchen, auth, config, etc.) composed into the full interface.

## Database

- [ ] Migrations 0001–0009 establish natural composite keys; migrations 0013–0016 reintroduce UUID PKs for `vm_tracking`, `node_kitchen_runs`, `kitchen_batches`, `git_kitchen_results`. This is a deliberate choice (these tables model ephemeral operational records, not domain entities) but should be documented in `project-conventions.md` under a "Primary Key Strategy" section.

## Phasing Notes

These are not debt — they are deliberate holds awaiting prerequisites.

- SAML authentication endpoints return 501 — waiting for customer environment access to test.
- Notification subsystem (`internal/notify/`) not yet implemented — entire feature deferred.
- TLS ACME mode logged as "not yet implemented" in `main.go`.
